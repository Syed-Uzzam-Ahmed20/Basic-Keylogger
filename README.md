The Basic Keylogger is a Python-based project designed to capture and log keystrokes on a system. This tool serves educational purposes, demonstrating how keylogging works and highlighting the importance of safeguarding systems against such vulnerabilities. Built using Python, it is lightweight and straightforward, with keystrokes stored in a text file for easy analysis. To use the keylogger, ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the pynput library (pip install pynput). After cloning the repository and running the script, the logged keystrokes will be saved in a file named keylog.txt. It is important to note that this tool is for ethical and educational use only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers to monitor activity without consent is both illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit permission before using this tool on any device.
